The three leaders of three boats changed the wasteland into cultivated areas and made them into 3 villages: Thang Nhat (First Thang), Thang Nhi (Second Thang) and Thang Tam (Third Thang). Pham Van Dinh managed First Thang village. Le Van Loc controlled Second Thang. Ngo Van Huyen directed Third Thang.
