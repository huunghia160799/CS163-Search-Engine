BEST FORD EVER? Ford Focus ST-Line X is packed with cutting-edge tech and drives sweetly — and is stiff competition for the Fiesta ST
Ford's vice president Steven Armstrong made a bold statement by saying their new Focus was their 'best car ever' — and he quite possibly could be right
First up, the phrase “best ever” is so over-used these days no one believes it.
I refer the jury to One Direction’s Best Song Ever. It got to No2, so it wasn’t even the best song that week.
Secondly, I’m fresh from driving the Fiesta ST which, for me, is the greatest car pound for pound on the planet.
Then there’s all you beautiful readers out there. Some will argue that the Mk2 Escort was Ford’s finest hour.
Others will say Escort Cosworth. Capri. GT. Even the Transit. Who said Probe? Joker.
So I was understandably ­sceptical about all the love for the fourth-gen Focus. Until I drove one. It turns out big swinging d*** might have a point — the lower, wider Focus drives sweetly, looks great, adds more space and, to top it all, it is loaded with cutting-edge tech.
Plus it’s more tailored to individual choice.
There’s now a car for everyone: normal five-door hatch, estate, tall Active crossover, tall Active crossover estate, sporty ST-Line and posh Vignale. And there’s another bonus.
It shares the same 1.5-litre three-pot as the Fiesta ST — albeit ­lowered to 182hp — bolted to a best-in-class chassis with fancy independent rear suspension. Fast, fun, well balanced, precise turn-in. It filled me with puppy dog ­enthusiasm.
Three drive modes — eco, normal and sport — are standard and you can pay more for adaptive suspension.
That engine is also a world-first, dropping from three cylinders to two when coasting, to save on fuel and lower emissions,and re-engaging under load without even a mouse’s hiccup.
