Synopsis - Someone has turned the universe upside down! Millie and Nina are adrift in space! Rail Claymore is running for his life! 
Kain is hiding out! And Kali has just taken over the Universal Guardians! The only thing that could make matters worse is if an evil rival suddenly

villains who are out to get Kain right now. Things look bad, but the psi-blade master never says "die". Surely Kain will come out on top as he always has. 
There's no such thing as an invincible villain. Is there?
