“They say that falling in love is wonderful,” goes the old song, and I suppose that’s right. But it can also be extremely inconvenient. Love happens at a bad time for Wilson Ugabe (Cake-Baly Marcelo), the protagonist of this Hungarian film. A middle-aged immigrant from Nigeria, Wilson has a lot on his plate from the opening scene, in which he’s depicted flunking Hungary’s compulsory exam that will determine his eligibility for citizenship.

“Don’t come back for another year,” one of the exam’s proctors says to Wilson. But he is not easily dissuaded. Eva (Tunde Szalontay), the manager at the supermarket where Wilson works as a security guard (and where he is later awarded Employee of the Year), recommends that he hire her sister, Maria (Agnes Mahr), as a tutor to help him with language skills and historical lore.

No sooner does he start his studies than he’s obliged (due to his good nature and conscience) to shelter a pregnant Iranian migrant with no papers, who soon gives birth in his flat. And then Wilson and Maria, who’s married with two good-for-nothing, live-in adult children, fall hard for each other.

The film, directed by Roland Vranik from a script by Mr. Vranik and Ivan Szabo, is a careful, compassionate and beautifully acted character drama with a social conscience. The viewer may be exasperated by some of the seemingly poor decisions made by the characters. (Wilson’s stubborn masculine pride, or what seems like that, can be especially frustrating.) But by the end of the picture, what hits hardest is the credible depiction of the desperate straits the refugee characters find themselves in despite their best efforts.
