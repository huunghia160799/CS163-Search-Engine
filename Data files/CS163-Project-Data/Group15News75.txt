Tour de France 2018 teams and riders: Full provisional startlist including Team Sky's four-time champion Chris Froome 

As with all WorldTour races, each of the 18 teams that make up the top-flight of professional cycling receive an invite and in the case of the Tour de France, all teams are contracted to race.

In addition to the WorldTour teams, race organisers ASO handed wildcard spots to Cofidis Solutions Crédits, Direct-Énergie, Fortuneo-Samsic and Wanty-Groupe Gobert. Of the 22 teams starting the 105th edition of the Tour, five – Ag2r-La Mondiale, Cofidis, Solutions Crédits, Direct-Énergie, FDJ, Fortuneo-Oscaro – are French.

Each team starts with eight riders – one fewer than in previous years following a rule change introduced by the International Cycling Union.

While teams are yet to confirm their line-ups, provisional squads are starting to take shape as sporting and team managers eye their riders' form in the final few races before the Tour gets under way on July 7.

As the clock ticks down to the start of the second grand tour of the season, the 3,351 kilometre – or 2,082 miles – race from Noirmoutier-en-l’île to Paris, Telegraph Sport will keep you updated with who is in contention to make the start line in the Vendée.
