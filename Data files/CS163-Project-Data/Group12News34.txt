John Zorn
When looking at John Zorn's hyperactive release schedule on Tzadik, the record label he runs,
it's easy to feel overwhelmed.
Where to start? His recent pair of compositions for classical ensembles, or an album from his 
latest metal group? Oh, look: Last year‚Äôs book of tunes for small jazz combo seems to have 
attracted some of the best improvising players in the world. Perhaps it makes sense to select 
that other, also recent recording, the one that merges several of these stylistic inspirations 
you know, for efficiency's sake.
But the real fun comes from bingeing on several of Mr. Zorn's projects at once. And something 
akin to this strategy seems to have guided the Brooklyn space National Sawdust, which hosted 
him for a three-concert stand this weekend. While the shows were tied to Sawdust's Hildegard 
Month, with each program paying tribute to female artists, they also offered a compact yet 
substantive tour through Mr. Zorn's many creative guises.
An early set on Friday was dominated by two recent classical works. In Die Traumdeutungù (2017), 
composed for the Guggenheim Museum's coming exhibition of paintings by Hilma af Klint, the 
pianist Stephen Gosling and the violinist David Fulmer gave a glance at Mr. Zorn's current 
approach to chamber music. His work in this idiom was once unsparing in its aggression, but there's 
now more room for delicacy.
