CLONE PHONE This great Huawei phone looks just like an iPhone X – but is on sale for under £250
IF YOU want the iPhone X but can't afford the ludicrous £999 price tag, then take a gander at this deal for a sub-£250 smartphone that looks just like it.
It comes from Huawei and is the cheapest member of the P20 family – which also includes the lauded P20 Pro.
There are plenty of iPhone X clones on the market, including the £469 OnePlus 6, but none of them are this cheap.
At £249.95, the Huawei P20 Lite is currently available for fifty quid less than its original asking price of £299.95 from Argos.
Like other Apple wannabes, the P20 Lite packs a notch at the top of the display that houses its 16-megapixel dual-lens camera.
That little cutout means more display space: the phone boasts a 5.84-inch full HD screen, which though it can't match the iPhone X's OLED screen (or even the Samsung Galaxy S9's AMOLED display) is good enough for most tasks.
Rounding out the features is FaceID, which like the iPhone X (and a bunch of other Android phones) unlocks the device by scanning your pretty mug.
And there's a 3,000 mAh battery with fast-charging support and 64Gb of internal storage.
If you do decide to snap up the Huawei P20 Lite, we'd recommend downloading the upcoming GPU Turbo update, which the company promises will allow even mid-range phones to handle powerful mobile games at a higher frame rate.
Huawei is boasting that the upgrade will see phones with simple Graphic processing units (like the P20 Lite) outperforming devices with stronger specs.
