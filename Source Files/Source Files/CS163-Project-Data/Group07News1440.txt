People shared their stories of how they met their partners and they're just lovely

It's a question as old as time itself, but one that truly never gets old â€” "How did you two meet?"

One curious tweeter posed this question to the internet, asking followers to share their stories of how they met their partners. And, boy, did the internet deliver. 

One Twitter user tweeted that they had met their partner "through World of Warcraft trade chat." The pair chatted over Skype for one year before getting in to a long term relationship. Now the couple live together in Norway! 

One woman tweeted that she met her partner because he was her Lyft driver. They couldn't stop chatting and they've been "best friends from that day on." She added that they're currently shopping for an engagement ring together. 

Some of the coupling up stories are delightfully simple. One Twitter user said her now-partner messaged her on Facebook to ask her for a drink. They went along and the "rest is history." Simple as that!

One woman tweeted that her now-partner posted selfies on Twitter and a mutual friend retweeted them, making them appear in her timeline. She liked the look of the chap so she messaged him and asked for his number. "We've been together ever since," she wrote.
