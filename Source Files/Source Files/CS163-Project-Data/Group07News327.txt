Anime: A Guide To Japanese Animation - Protoculture Addicts magazine presents the most essential anime reference in English: 
a filmography of the first 30 years of anime in Japan! This comprehensive volume covers all the anime produced in Japan during the Sixties, 
the Seventies and most of the Eighties -- including not only the movies and OVAs, but also the TV series and not only those that were popular or translated in English, 
but even the most obscure anime! It offers over 300 pages of information and lists chronologically over 1,200 titles, from Astro Boy to Akira! 
Each notice gives the original title, its literal translation, production company, category (adventure, comedy, sci-fi, etc.), duration or number of episodes, 
release or airing date, distribution company, as well as a short description and commentary. The notice is preceded by an identification number 
(to facilitate research in the indexes) and its type (Series, Movie, OVA, Special). Each year is introduced, highlighting the themes or titles that 
marked that particular year. The book also has several indexes to make any research easy. If you are looking for any infomation about the early 
years of anime (Who animated Gegege no Kitaro? When was Mazinger produced? How many episode Marine Boy had? etc.), 
you will most probably find it in this book. There is no other English-language reference work detailing how animation started in Japan!
