NAP

Wor Lass, Ayr 4.45

WOR LASS got right back on track this month with a win at Musselburgh in a Lady Riders' Handicap under Rachel Richardson. Things were kept relatively simple there, racing prominently and moving smoothly at the furlong-pole to take the prize. The veteran mare has gone up only 2lb for that win and should hold strong claims back here at Ayr, where she is a three-time C&D winner. The firm conditions are a plus and WOR LASS is value at 9/2, despite the strong claims of likely favourite Ingleby Hollow.
NB

Englishman, Windsor 7.30

Milton Bradley's ENGLISHMAN looks a very appealing each-way proposition in Windsor's feature contest on Monday evening at odds of 12/1. He was denied a hat-trick last time at Newmarket but it was a race that wasn't really run to suit and he was never able to land any sort of blow. More tellingly, he is dropping right back in grade for this race and returning to a C&D where he is a three-time winner and has scored this term already. There are enough prominent racers here to believe he'll get a strong pace to aim at and ENGLISHMAN looks overpriced at this morning's odds.
