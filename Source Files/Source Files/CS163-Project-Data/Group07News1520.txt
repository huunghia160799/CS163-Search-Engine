Best noughties pop songs 

By Neil McCormick, Music Critic

The 00s were a decade in which the music business suffered near catastrophic collapse while music itself invaded every aspect of our lives.

It sometimes felt like there has been no centre of pop gravity, as though everything has migrated to an ever-expanding margin, where every taste is catered for. Arguably, the biggest phenomena were not individual artists or thrilling new genres, but illegal downloading, the invention of the iPod and iTunes, the free music zones of YouTube, MySpace and Spotify and the democratisation of the means of production and distribution that allowed any kid with a computer to become a legend in their own bedroom studio.

Meanwhile, Top Of The Pops died from lack of interest while the charts became strangely hyperactive. No one musical trend defined the decade. The strongest argument could be made for the rise of modern hip hop-inflected R&B, where even mainstream pop idols (such as Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears) effectively “urbanised” their music. In America, in particular, these genres  dominated radio and the charts, delivering such acts as Rhianna, Beyonce, The Black Eyed Peas, Akon and Kanye West around the world.

In Britain, we were temporarily distracted by “landfill indie” (ubiquitous skinny boys with scratchy guitars) and a kind of epic soft rock (Coldplay and their brothers in cardigans, from sensitive singer-songwriters to coffee-table rock bands) but little of it sounded fresh. Women increasingly came to the fore, some with authentically soulful voices and striking characters, some blow-dried, sexed up and autotuned to within an inch of their lives.

It seems a bitty, fragmented decade. Yet somehow pop continued to do what it does best. There are still songs we all share, just not disseminated in familiar ways. You could hear them on TV, films, adverts and video games, in shopping malls and pubs, or at festivals. They were sung in crass cover versions by TV talent show wannabes and blared by tuneless amateurs in karaoke sessions.

These are 100 songs that define the decade. It is not a critic’s list, and not strictly a hit list; rather it’s one of tunes you find yourself humming whether you approve of them or not, the universal songs that infiltrated popular culture and provided a soundtrack to our lives. And laid out like this, it strikes me the decade doesn’t seem quite so bad.

Ode to fancying strangers on public transport captured the nation’s heart.

15. Sounds of the Underground (2002), Girls Aloud

Xenomania’s blend of electro and guitars set pop production standards.

14. Beautiful Day (2000), U2

Between despair and optimism, U2’s sky-high anthem was appropriated for TV football.

13. Crazy (2006), Gnarls Barkley

Delicious Motown-esque meditation on insanity. Topped the charts for nine weeks.

12. Gold Digger (2005), Kanye West

Jamie Foxx gave Kanye’s kiss-off to avaricious ladies a raw blues edge.

11. Dry Your Eyes (2004), The Streets

Mike Skinner’s urban vernacular bloke-ballad had 'em sobbing into their pints.

10. Hey Ya (2003), Outkast 

The battle of duelling egos in Outkast was thrown into overdrive when Andre 3000, one half of the Atlanta hip hop duo, was cloned eight times in the video for this goofily contagious Prince-ish funk-rocker, and conquered the globe.

9. Can’t Get You Out Of My Head (2001), Kylie

Never has a pop song more effectively done what it says on the tin: the Cathy Dennis and Rob Davis-penned single sinks its playground chant of a hook into the brain and just refuses to let go as Kylie sexes it up.


8. Seven Nation Army (2003), The White Stripes

Driven by the noughties’ best rock riff (not a bass, a semi-acoustic guitar dropped down an octave) this channeled all Jack White’s anger and ambition into an electric yowl aimed at everyone “from the Queen of England to the hounds of hell”.

7. Bleeding Love (2008), Leona Lewis

Even Simon Cowell must have been embarrassed with Pop Idol and X Factor’s parade of cruise ship cabaret fodder before Leona Lewis’s supple vocals restored some credibility to his search for a superstar. Supplied with a US written and produced ballad, Leona conquered all.

6. Hurt (2002), Johnny Cash

A ridiculously potent Nine Inch Nails cover delivered in weary Old Testament tones that cut to the marrow. Acted as the great man’s elegy and the video, contrasting the frail Cash nearing his end with his boisterous younger self, is heart-breaking.


5. Paper Planes (2008), M.I.A.

A sing song, half chant, half rap riposte to post Iraq war paranoia, M.I.A.’s much sampled sonic collage was a bravura oddity. The London born Sri Lankan Tamil mixes up The Clash with Bhangra beats, while gunshots and cash registers ring out.

4. Yellow (2000), Coldplay

The song that launched Coldplay’s stadium filling career and spawned a decade of male falsetto choruses (see James Blunt etc) Chris Martin’s plaintive call of unrequited love had no title until he found a copy of the Yellow Pages in the studio.

3. Crazy In Love (2003), Beyonce


Something old, something new: this unstoppably groovy club slammer marries a raspy 70’s Chi-Lites horn sample with a hip hop inflected go-go beat. The romantic union of R’n’B sweetheart Beyonce Knowles with heavyweight rap supremo Jay Z added frisson to the affair.

2. I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor (2005), Arctic Monkeys

Britain’s new favourite band, the fresh faced Sheffield quartet were a word of myspace sensation. Witty, keenly observational and delivering the fast paced lyricism of rap with the energy of nu metal, the Monkeys made every other indie band sound old and vapid.

1. Rehab (2006), Amy Winehouse

There was a tragic defiance to Winehouse’s career-making hit, bringing together some of the defining elements of the decade in one monster single. The sound is unashamedly retro, a bluesy shouter lent a modern edge by hip hop rhythms and bold sentiments. Winehouse had an authentic soul voice and vivid character but her fame owed as much to her public disintegration as her music. In the vacuum left by Top Of The Pops, the tabloidization of pop became the real mass market. Stars are no longer revered so much as cut down to size. That it would all end in tears was sadly predictable but self destruction has never sounded so uplifting.

Indie trio turn whooping psychedelic mysticism into pop gold.
