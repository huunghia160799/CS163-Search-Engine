‘YOU TOOK MY LIFE, I’M TAKING YOURS’ Gran, 92, ‘shoots her son dead because he planned to put her in a care home’

Anna Mae Blessing has been charged with murder after allegedly gunning down the 72-year-old at their Arizona home

A GRAN shot her son dead because he planned to put her in a care home when she became "difficult to live with", it is claimed.

Anna Mae Blessing reportedly told the 72-year-old: "You took my life, so I'm taking yours" moments after she gunned him down at their Arizona home.

Blessing, 92, who has been charged with murder, told police she'd intended to take her own life too.

The shooting happened on Monday morning in the town of Fountain Hills, police records obtained by local media say.

Blessing's son, whose name has not been released, wanted her to leave for an assisted living facility, it's claimed.

The OAP concealed two firearms in her robe pockets before confronting her son in his bedroom, police said in a statement.

During the ensuing argument, she allegedly pulled out one revolver, purchased in the 1970s, and fired at her son.

Police found the son dead, with two bullet wounds to his neck and jaw.

Blessing then pointed the gun at her son's 57-year-old girlfriend, who managed to wrestle it away and throw it into a corner of the room, it is claimed.

She then allegedly pulled out a second pistol, which she told police her late husband had given to her in the 1970s.

The girlfriend is said to have managed to knock this one out of Blessing's hands, too, before fleeing and calling cops.
