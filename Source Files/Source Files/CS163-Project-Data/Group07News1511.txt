Vinnie Paul, the co-founder and drummer of the metal band Pantera, has died aged 54.

"Vincent Paul Abbott aka Vinnie Paul has passed away," Pantera announced on social media. "Paul is best known for his work as the drummer in the bands Pantera and Hellyeah. No further details are available at this time. The family requests you please respect their privacy during this time."

No immediate cause of death was given.

Paul, who was born in Texas, formed Pantera in 1981 with his brother, "Dimebag" Darrell Abbott, and bassist Rex Brown. After recording three albums with vocalists Donnie Hart and Terry Glaze, the band recruited singer Phil Anselmo in 1987 to form Pantera's classic lineup of Anselmo, Abbott, Paul and Brown.

The band had a number one album in 1994 – Far Beyond Driven – and earned four Grammy nominations, but broke up in 2003.



In 2004, the two brothers formed a new band, Damageplan, but later that year Abbott was shot and killed onstage by a 25-year-old man.

Two years later, Paul joined metal supergroup Hellyeah, alongside the former Mudvayne singer Chad Gray and Nothingface guitarist Tom Maxwell.

Fellow rock stars have paid tribute to Paul on Twitter.

"Heaven has Dimebag and Vinnie now," wrote Blink 182 drummer Travis Barker.

"Loved when Pantera did shows with us and in later years Vinnie was always front and center at all KISS shows," wrote Kiss guitarist Paul Stanley.



Meanwhile, Kiss's frontman Gene Simmons said: "Rest in peace, Vinnie. Our prayers and good wishes go to his family, friends and fans."
