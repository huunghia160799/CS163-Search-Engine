CALL OF DESPAIR Firefighter listened to mum trapped in Grenfell Tower wishing for death after her child had died

Station manager Daniel Egan choked back tears as he told the inquiry of her despair when she spoke to him

A FIREFIGHTER yesterday relived a harrowing call by a mum trapped in the Grenfell blaze who wanted to die.

Station manager Daniel Egan choked back tears as he told the inquiry of her despair when she spoke to him.

He said: “She was saying she just wants to go.

“One of her kids had gone, the other wasn’t moving and she had no reason to do anything.”

Mr Egan said he knew the fire could not be put out and begged bosses to abandon the “stay put” advice to residents.

Colleague John O’Hanlon said a victim landed ten yards from him after jumping from the tower.

The inferno killed 72 at the flats in North Kensington, West London, in June last year.

The inquiry continues.
