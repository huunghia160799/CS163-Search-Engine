Ariana Grande talks to 'British Vogue' about her mental health after the Manchester attack

Ariana Grande has talked to British Vogue about the impact of the Manchester attack — in which 22 people died — on her mental health. 

In an interview in the July issue of Vogue, which hits newsstands on 8 June, Grande said she was in regular contact with one of the fans who suffered shrapnel injuries in her legs. 

"I check in with Millie [Robson, 15 at the time] often on Twitter," Grande told Vogue. 

Asked if the "dizziness and extreme anxiety" were signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, Grande said she struggled to admit that she was suffering from PTSD. 

"I hate ... yeah ... admitting it but it very much is," she said. "That's what everyone was telling me. It's hard to talk about because so many people have suffered such severe, tremendous loss. But, yeah, it's a real thing." 

Per the NHS, PTSD is "an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events."

Grande said her fans and the families of people affected by the attack are also suffering from PTSD. 

"I know those families and my fans, and everyone there experienced a tremendous amount of it as well," she said. "Time is the biggest thing."

Grande also expressed her hesitancy in talking about her own experience. 

"I feel like I shouldn't even be talking about my own experience — like I shouldn't even say anything," she said. "I don't think I'll ever know how to talk about it and not cry." 

The singer also talked about her own struggle with anxiety, which she's "always had". 

"I've never really spoken about it because I thought everyone had it, but when I got home from tour it was the most severe I think it's ever been," she said.
