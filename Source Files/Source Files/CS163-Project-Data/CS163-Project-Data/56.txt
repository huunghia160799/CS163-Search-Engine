Arrive at Ho Chi Minh City, we would be mentioned Cholon. Cholon is common name of the area of Districts 5, District 6, Distric 10 and a part of District 11. There are many Chinese living there, and there are lots of pagodas and temples built by Chinese. One of the most ancient Chinese temples and pagodas there isThienHau Pagoda (common name is Ba Pagoda).
ThienHau Pagoda is located at 710 Nguyen Trai Street, District 5 Ho Chi Minh City. The pagoda was built by a Chinese group, whichhad come from QuangChau of China, in 1760. 
The main god worshiped in the pagoda is ThienHauThanh Mau, whose first name is MiChau. She was born in PhuocKien of China, in 1044, Tong Nhan Tong dynasty. When she was eight years old, she could read. She became a nun of Taoism when she was eleven years old. When she was thirteen years old, she was given ancient books by gods. Since then, she had trained until she reached the peak of the way in Taoism.
One day, her father named Lam TichKhanh was on a boat with her two older brothers to transport salt to GiangTay to sell. On the way, the boat was struck by a big storm. At that time, she was sitting to weave fabric beside her mother, but her soul went out to save her father and brother.
She used her teeth to keep father’s corner of the coat and the two hands kept the two brother. At that time, her mother called her, which makes her answer. She just opened her lips to answer, her father was swept away by the water and she saved only the two brothers.
Since then, each time boats have been in danger, people have called her to have her save. In 1110, she was name ThienHauThanh Mau by Tong Dynasty. Since then, in China, many temples have been built to worship her and they were called after her name, ThienHauThanh Mau, shortly ThienHau.
Afterwards, because not submitting Thanh dynasty, some Chinese came to some countries of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, to earn their living. Most Chinese had to cross the sea to come to Vietnam, and to be safe, they prayed ThienHauThanh Mau for support.
Reaching Vietnam safely, Oversea Chinese believed that ThienHau helped. Therefore, they set up some temple to worship her. ThienHau Temple or ThienHau pagoda is one ofpagodas and temples built most early in Cholon as well as in Ho Chi Minh City.
