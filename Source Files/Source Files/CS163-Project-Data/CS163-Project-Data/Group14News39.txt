Emma Watson sends moving message to people voting in Ireland’s abortion referendum

Emma Watson has tweeted an inspiring message to people voting in Ireland's historic abortion referendum. 

On May 25, Irish people cast their votes to decide whether the country's 8th amendment—which currently makes abortion illegal in almost all circumstances—should be repealed. 

"A vote for the freedom to choose, a vote for women's rights, a vote for women's control over their bodies, a vote for women's health and safety, a vote towards equality," wrote Watson on Twitter.

The Beauty and The Beast actor added that she was "thinking of Ireland."

The amendment went into effect in 1983, and since then more than 150,000 women have travelled overseas to gain access to abortion services. 

In the days prior to the vote, Irish people living in far-flung corners of the world made their way back to the country—sometimes travelling thousands of miles—in order to have their say in the momentous referendum.
