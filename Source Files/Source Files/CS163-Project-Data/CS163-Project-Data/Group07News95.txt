Wait, the US didn't qualify?
Nope, the US men's national team didn't make it for the first time since 1986. But don't let the absence of the USMNT ruin your summer of soccer fun. There's modern-day Viking heroes Iceland (and a number of other teams) that you can adopt for the month.
Remind me who the best soccer players are.
Sure, here's a quick primer:
Lionel Messi has done everything in his career -- short of winning a World Cup for Argentina
Cristiano Ronaldo, fresh off his fifth UEFA Champions League victory, is hoping to capture Portugal's first World Cup title
Neymar leads Brazil, which hasn't won the World Cup since 2002, and 16 years qualifies as a long World Cup drought for the practitioners of The Beautiful Game
The above three players are probably the biggest names in soccer, at least to this American's untrained eye. You will likely also hear these names mentioned this summer while watching the World Cup:
Gabriel Jesus, Brazil's other star
Timo Werner, defending champ Germany's stellar young forward
Toni Kroos, Germany's do-it-all midfielder
Luis SuÃ¡rez, Uruguay's all-time leading scorer and ear biter
Francisco RomÃ¡n AlarcÃ³n SuÃ¡rez, aka Isco, Spain's insanely skilful attacking midfielder

Best TVs for watching the World Cup 2018
When does the knockout stage begin?
Things start to get serious at the end of June. The group stage runs from June 14 to June 28, and then the knockout stage begins on Saturday, June 30, when the winners advance and the losers go home.
I only care about the final. When's the final?
The 2018 World Cup champion will be crowned on July 15. The final match is set to start at 11 a.m. ET (8 a.m. PT) on Sunday, July 15 from Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. It will be broadcast on Fox.
Where can I watch highlights?
Twitter and Snapchat have partnered with Fox Sports to show highlights in the US. You can see every goal scored from every game just moments after it happens on Twitter, in addition to game previews, recaps and other live programming from Moscow's Red Square with US soccer greats Landon Donovan and Alexi Lalas. On Snapchat, you can watch videos of behind-the-scenes highlights and reactions from soccer fans across the world.
