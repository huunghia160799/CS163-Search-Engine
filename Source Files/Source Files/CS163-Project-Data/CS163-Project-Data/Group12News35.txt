Benjamin Pavard, and His World Cup Highlight, Came Out of Nowhere
KAZAN, Russia — It was one of the most spectacular goals of this World Cup, and what made Benjamin 
Pavard’s 20-yard half-volley against Argentina all the more remarkable was that so few saw him 
coming.
A little more than a year ago, Pavard, 22, was playing in the German second division with Stuttgart. 
Called up to France’s national team for the first time in November, he was not expected to make 
Manager Didier Deschamps’s final 23-man roster for the World Cup in Russia. He certainly was not 
expected to displace the incumbent at right back, Djibril Sidibé, in the starting lineup.
But there was Pavard at the heart of the matter on Saturday, making his mark — and the World Cup 
highlight reel.
Pavard pounced with Les Bleus trailing Argentina by 2-1 in the second half, scoring not only his 
first goal for France but the first goal of his career with his foot. “I’ve scored two goals with 
my head, but, I mean, I never score goals,” he said after France’s 4-3 victory earned it a place 
in the quarterfinals against Uruguay on Friday. “But the ball came, and I did not ask myself a 
bunch of questions. And it worked.”
France-Argentina was a white-knuckle ride, full of quick strikes, abrupt shifts in fortune and, of 
course, goals. But if the French get past Uruguay on Friday and continue their latest deep run in 
a World Cup, Pavard’s goal will loom ever larger.
Argentina had commandeered the momentum by taking the lead in the 57th minute. Pavard was covering 
Gabriel Mercado when Mercado redirected Lionel Messi’s shot past French goalkeeper Hugo Lloris to 
make it 1-0. But Pavard compensated memorably just nine minutes later, combining with the other 22-year-old 
newcomer in France’s back four: Lucas Hernández.
