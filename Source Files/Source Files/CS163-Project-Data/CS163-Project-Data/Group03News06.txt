FOOTBALL STRIP New challenger for Russia’s ‘hottest fan’ as architect Maria Liman strips off in honour of World Cup penalty hero Igor Akinfeev

Maria Liman was so impressed with Russia's 'superhero' 'keeper Igor Akinfeev she took off all her clothes

A SEXY model yesterday posed topless in awe of Russia's star goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev.

Maria Liman, 24, stripped for the camera — and her 441,000 Instagram admirers — as she was so impressed with Akinfeev's reflexes in Russia's latest World Cup scalp.

The stunning architect and model called the 32-year-old 'keeper "superman".

She posted online: "Akinfeev is the best. I am still shocked!

"I am speechless. Russia is the Champion….

"I am proud of our guys. Honestly, I could not believe it."

 Akinfeev was the Russia hero after his two saves in the tense penalty shootout against Spain saw his nation progress to the quarter-finals.

Spain became the latest of a string of footballing greats to get booted out the tournament.

The stunner, who has a degree in architecture, bared all in her native city of Rostov-on-Don, west Russia.

And she warned Russia must beat Croatia in the quarter-finals on Saturday night — or she'll never show off her assets again.
