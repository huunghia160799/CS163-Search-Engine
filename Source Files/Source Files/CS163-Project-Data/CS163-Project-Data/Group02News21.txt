Lorraine Reyes is a former ADV graduate who now calls the Pacific Northwest home. She describes her almost four year tenure at the Houston based anime 
giant as follows: “I was the Art Director/Senior Artist. I had a hand in the packaging design/production for nearly every title from late 1994 to early 1998. 
That's over 100 titles! I've done some background voices, video opening titles, copyproofed some subtitled films, created ads for various magazines, 
created several logos, spent lots of hours coaching, guiding and nudging the graphic designers who've worked on various projects that fell under my jurisdiction.”

More recently, though Lorraine was the Art/Creative Director of marketing for Bungie Software Products, Inc. who developed the 3rd person action game, 
Oni. Lorraine's artwork has also appeared in Elfquest: Wild Hunt which has been collected and is currently available in graphic novel form.

Currently she is an artist for a top secret gaming project at a top secret software/game development company at a top secret location somewhere 
insignificant in Redmond, Washington.

the streets of Downtown Seattle.

Ms. Ohno has given numerous recitals and concerts in classical Japanese dancing arts ("Hanayagi Fumiryu" and "Naga-uta Shamisen") at several large
