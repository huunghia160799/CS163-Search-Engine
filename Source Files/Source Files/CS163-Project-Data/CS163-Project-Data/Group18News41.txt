Vietnamese banks protest after prosecutors call for $266 million to be returned at fraud trial
Pham Cong Danh is accused of stealing the money from his own bank and using it to secure loans with three other lenders.
The Vietnam Banks Association (VBA) lodged a complaint on Thursday regarding a request made by prosecutors at an ongoing banking fraud trial in Ho Chi Minh City.
At the trial of former chairman of Vietnam Construction Bank (VNCB) Pham Cong Danh, prosecutors on Wednesday requested the court to order Sacombank, BIDV and TPBank to return more than VND6.1 trillion ($270 million) to Construction Bank (formerly VNCB).
Danh is alleged to have used the amount to secure loans from the three banks, which then legally seized the money when the loans defaulted. However, prosecutors argued that Danh had illegally obtained the money by stealing from VNCB, so it must be returned. It should be down to Danh and his accomplices to repay the three banks, prosecutors said.
