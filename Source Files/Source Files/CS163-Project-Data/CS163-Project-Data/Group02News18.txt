2001-02-11 02:55 UTC-8
Many people have been complaining of a variety of problems viewing the Gundam Wing Volume 5 DVD and the Endless Waltz Special Edition DVD; 
ANN's review of Endless Waltz has been delayed because of two bad discs.

Problems have been reported getting Endless Waltz to play at all on some players, while other people have experienced problems towards the end of the movie, 
and other problems during the conclusion and the credits.

Similar problems have been experienced with Gundam Wing volume 5 where it freezes at the 3rd and 23rd chapters.

Bandai has responded to enquiries regarding these problems with the following message:

These problems seem to primarily affect Pioneer and Toshiba players, with the problems seeming to be the most pronounced with Pioneers. 
The defect affects every single copy of each title. So far, every attempt to contact Bandai has been met with a generic reply, 
with instructions on returning the DVDs for replacement. Obviously Bandai doesn't understand the problem, as replacing the discs won't solve a thing. 
Here's a list of the titles, and the players that some people are having trouble with:
