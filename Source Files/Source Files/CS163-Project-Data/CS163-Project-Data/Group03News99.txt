DAY SAVER Amazon Prime Day dates revealed – ‘epic’ 36 hours with more than a MILLION deals coming soon
IT'S OFFICIAL: this year's Amazon Prime Day deals extravaganza will kick off on July 16.
Better still, it's the longest Prime Day ever, with Amazon flogging discounted goodies for an extended 36-hour run.The dates for Amazon Prime Day were leaked just last month, but it's now official.
Deals will begin appearing on Amazon from noon on July 16 right through to midnight on July 17.
Last year's Amazon Prime Day lasted for 30 hours, but Amazon has lengthened the event for 2018.
It's almost certainly so Amazon can collect more cash from deal-hungry Brits – but it's great news for consumers too.

That'll cost you either £7.99 per month, or £79 for an entire year (which works out cheaper, at £6.58 per month).
Amazon Prime memberships are a decent investment, getting you free one-day delivery, plus access to movies and TV shows through Amazon Prime.
