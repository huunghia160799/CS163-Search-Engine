NBA Draft 2018: Start time, draft order, how to watch and more.
"Unless you are a fan of the Golden State Warriors, who won their second consecutive title (and third in the last four years), the NBA offseason is arguably more fun than the actual NBA season. Free agency and trade rumors abound, with LeBron James potentially leaving Cleveland for the second time and Kawhi Leonard wanting out of San Antonio.
The first domino to fall in terms of player movement, however, is the NBA Draft. Rosters for next season will start taking shape on Thursday night when the NBA holds its annual draft. We will find out where prized college prospects such as Deandre Ayton, Marvin Bagley III and Trae Young will land along with Slovenian teenager and EuroLeague MVP Luka Doncic.
