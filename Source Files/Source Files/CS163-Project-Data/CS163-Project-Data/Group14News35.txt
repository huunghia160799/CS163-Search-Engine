Pornhub announces Pornhub Nation, a new, uh, 'interactive art' exhibit

If you ever wanted to know what the future would look like according to Pornhub, get to Los Angeles this July as the adult video website launches a new "interactive art installation" called "Pornhub Nation."

The entire installation will take up 3,000 square feet and will, according to the company, "depict a futuristic, utopian society formed by Pornhub and feature multiple exhibits playing on government branches and bureaucratic organizations." It will include adult film luminaries like Asa Akira and Abella Danger as presidents of Pornhub Nation.

In case you're wondering which agencies will be represented, they've so far mentioned the National Sexurity ASSociation (NSA), the Domination Masochistic Vroomvroom (DMV), and space program ASSA. I'm sure you can see what they did there. 

The seven-room project was put together by photographer/artist Maggie West and conceptual artist Ryder Ripps, depicting Pornhub Nation in the year (what else?) 2069 when, says Ripps in a press release, "attention grabbing eye-candy dominates the visual landscape and a milieu where sexuality runs free."

To be honest, at the rate we're going in 2018, simply making it to 2069 is a big win. If the country is anything like Pornhub Nation, well, that's just a nice bonus. 

The event kicks off July 14th and runs through August 18th. Tickets for the event are on sale now (you have to be 21 or up to buy, duh). 

The "experience" will last an hour, but the memories will last many lifetimes.
