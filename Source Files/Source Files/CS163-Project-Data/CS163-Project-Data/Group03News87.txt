SECRET MOUSE Believe us, this hidden iPhone hack will revolutionise the way you text
YOUR iPhone's best kept secret is a hidden hack that will transform the way you text.
EDITING a message on your iPhone is way harder than it has any right to be – but this easy trick turns the phone's keyboard into a laptop-style trackpad with a cursor that you can move by touching the screen.
With it, you'll be able to precisely go back and forth between each character in a text without having to furiously tap the display.
It's all thanks to 3D Touch: a feature introduced by Apple to iPhones in 2015 that allows the handsets to recognise different degrees of touch pressure to perform a variety of tasks.
You can use it for at-a-glance calendar notifications, detailed weather info, and prioritising downloads, and more.
But its best function is its revolutionary ability to change the way you compose messages.ead on to find out how to use 3D Touch to transform your iPhone's keyboard into a trackpad – a trick that works on the iPhone 6S and beyond.
How to use 3D Touch to turn your iPhone keyboard into a trackpad
Launch the app you want to use and bring up the keyboard.
Press firmly on the keyboard.
Swipe your finger around to move the cursor.
Press deeper to select text (the way you would "click" on a laptop trackpad).
Let go to finish.
