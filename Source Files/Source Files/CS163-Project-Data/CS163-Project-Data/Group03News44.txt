A source told The Mirror: “Thomas is heartbroken.”

Thomas now worries the Duchess of Sussex, 36, will never travel to his home in Rosarito, Mexico.

He is said to have told friends: “I don’t know if she’ll visit.

"I think that relationship is lost now.”

Thomas had heart surgery three days before Meghan and Harry wed and was unable to walk her down the aisle.

Thomas later told TV’s Good Morning Britain that Meghan cried when she learned her dad would not be at the wedding.

He also said he apologised for staging photos. He said: “They were very forgiving.”
