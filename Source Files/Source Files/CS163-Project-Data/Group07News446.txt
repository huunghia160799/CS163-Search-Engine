BOUNCY CASTLES 'BAN' Theresa May could ban bouncy castles after two children lost their lives playing on inflatables

Theresa May was asked by Tory MP Robert Halfon to bring in a temporary ban so that safety regulations can be urgently reviewed

THE PM signalled she was ready to ban bouncy castles after two little girls died in separate incidents on the inflatables.

Asked to urgently review regulations and bring in a temporary ban, Theresa May said if necessary “recommendations to improve safety” would be brought in as soon as possible.

Former Tory minister Robert Halfon said action was needed after two “horrific tragedies”.

He said he had been contacted by the grandmother of Summer Grant, seven, killed when a bouncy castle blew free from its moorings in 2016 in his Harlow constituency.

And on Sunday, three-year-old Ava-May Littleboy died from a head injury when she was thrown from a bouncy castle in Gorleston-on-Sea, near Great Yarmouth.

The PM offered her condolences to the families of Ava-May and Summer, saying she shared the MP’s concerns about the tragic incidents.

She said: “As regards the incident that took place at the weekend, I understand Norfolk Police, aided and working with the Health and Safety Executive, have started an investigation into the incident.

“It’s too early to know the cause of the incident but if any findings emerge from the investigation then the necessary recommendations to improve safety will be shared across the relevant sectors as soon as possible.”

One council - Havant Borough - has already banned the use of inflatables in any events taking place on its land.
