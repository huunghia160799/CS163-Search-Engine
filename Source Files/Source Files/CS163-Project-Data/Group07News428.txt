ENVOY IN V.I.P DEAL Theresa May accused of breaching Putin World Cup boycott by letting the British ambassador attend England’s game against Colombia

Laurie Bristow was among the official guests of FIFA who attended the game receiving VIP hospitality alongside ex-England defender Rio Ferdinand and Argentine hero Diego Maradona

The British ambassador to Russia received VIP treatment at the England v Colombia game last night - despite the Government's official boycott of Putin's World Cup.

No10 defended Laurie Bristow's attendance at the game - insisting he was the best person to provide "consular assistance" to England fans if they got in trouble.

Mr Bristow was among the official guests of FIFA who attended the game - receiving VIP hospitality alongside ex-England defender Rio Ferdinand and Argentine hero Diego Maradona.

Critics said it was a breach of the boycott the PM imposed after accusing Russia of poisoning ex-spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in March.

But No10 defended his attendance at the game - insisting it wasn't a breach because the boycott only technically applies to ministers and members of the Royal Family. And insiders insisted the ambassador was the best person to help with consular issues if England fans got into trouble at the game.

Announcing the boycott in March the PM told MPs: "This includes confirming there will be no attendance by Ministers - or indeed Members of the Royal Family - at this Summer’s World Cup in Russia."
