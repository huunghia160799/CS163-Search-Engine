PM ‘CONNING’ BRITS Theresa May is deceiving the public over Brexit claims Nigel Farage as he threatens return to frontline politics and prevent ‘betrayal’

The ex-Ukip boss says PM is ‘conning us all’’ and he feels ‘ like a right mug' for believing in her

THERESA May has been accused of deceiving the public with her repeated Brexit concessions by Nigel Farage.

The ex-Ukip boss says the Prime Minister is “conning us all” and he feels “like a right mug” for believing in her.

And he threatened to return to frontline politics if the process is delayed to make sure a clean break from Brussels is delivered.

Mr Farage said he will have no choice but to defend the UK from the outright "betrayal" of Mrs May’s Government.

Speaking on an LBC phone-in yesterday he said: “If they deliver Brexit in name only we’ll be furious. Many people engaged with this show will be furious.”

It comes as the PM is set to take her warring Cabinet to her Chequers country retreat to try and break the deadlock on coming up with a new customs system after we leave the EU.

In response to a caller asking what he would do if Article 50 was postponed he said: “I would have, in that situation that would be outright full and clear for the public to understand betrayal, in those circumstances I would have no choice.”

The MEP claimed Mrs May had misled the country into believing she would deliver a hard Brexit, but her latest policies were watering that down.

He said: “With all these concessions she’s making, it will effectively be Brexit in name only.

“And when she stands up today and says we’re leaving the Common Fishery Policy, the Agriculture Policy, the single market, she makes it sound like all of this is happening on March the 29th of next year.
