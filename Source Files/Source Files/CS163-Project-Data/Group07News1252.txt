Dead of AIDS and Forgotten in Potter’s Field
The bodies reached Hart Island on a ferry like all the others, in spare wooden boxes and bound for 
ignominious mass interment off the coast of the Bronx where New York City buries its unclaimed dead 
by the hundreds in long, shallow trenches.
But when these 17 bodies arrived in 1985, the island’s hardened crews, used to burying dozens of 
indigent people per week, recoiled. These were different. They had died from a widely feared nascent 
disease called AIDS, an illness that at the time had a skyrocketing death toll.
The bodies were kept out of the trenches and instead quarantined in a remote spot on the island’s 
southernmost tip, buried deep in individual graves.
“This was a scary time and people were avoiding AIDS patients like the plague,” recalled Eugene 
Ruppert, 69, who retired as a captain with New York City’s Department of Correction, which oversees 
burials on Hart Island.
The island would go on to receive scores, if not hundreds, of people who died during the AIDS 
epidemic, which during the 1980s and 1990s killed more than 100,000 people in New York, about a 
quarter of AIDS deaths nationwide during the same period.
Trying to pin down the precise number of those with AIDS buried on Hart Island is difficult. A 
longstanding stigma about the island and criticism that the burial practices are crude and outdated 
have made city officials reluctant to provide many details. Officials at several city agencies 
involved in the burials refused interview requests to discuss the issue and insisted that no data 
or any other information was available on AIDS burials.
