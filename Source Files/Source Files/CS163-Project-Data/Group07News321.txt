ADV Press release:

ADV Films is proud to announce their recent acquisition of the home video rights to the first 82 episodes of Sailor Moon, 
the #1 television series for girls on the Cartoon Network's "Toonami" programming block, from DiC Entertainment.

Sailor Moon is the story of Serena, a junior high school student who discovers that she has mystical powers and is destined to 
protect the world from the evil Queen Beryl and the fiends of the Negaverse. Gradually, 
Serena assembles a team of Sailor Scouts to help her battle the forces of darkness in the name of Queen Serenity of the Emperium. 
Sailor Mercury, Sailor Mars, Sailor Venus and Sailor Jupiter round out the rest of Sailor Moon's team. Sailor Moon is given her powers by Luna, 
a trusted advisor of Queen Serenity, who takes the form of Serena's cat and sticks with her through thick and thin.

The Sailor Scouts must take on the dwellers of the Negaverse, while also dealing with the problems of adolescence. 
Bad grades and crushes at Crossroads Junior High can be just as fearsome as the forces of evil. All the while, 
Serena moves slowly toward her destiny, to save the universe as Neo-Queen Serenity in the name of the Moon. It's not easy being a pretty soldier.

An anime sensation that has appeared in the "Lycos Top 50" consecutively for the past 41 weeks, 
Sailor Moon is a proven multi-billion dollar brand in specialty and mass channels, with products ranging from toys and games to clothing and school supplies.
