1,000 people picked up their Boring Company flamethrowers this weekend

It was a hot time in Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon.

Sorry, sorry. (No I'm not.) It's been five months since The Boring Company sold 20,000 space age flamethrowers to... people who want to burn things, I guess. On Saturday, 1,000 of those buyers got to pick up their purchase at a party thrown by Elon Musk.

Here's live footage of Musk testing out the very first unit.OK, fine. There's no footage of Musk himself wielding a Boring Company Flamethrower. But social media is flooded with photos of flamethrower buyers testing out their new toy.

Ah, 2018. When consumer-friendly flamethrowers that look more like video game cosplay accessories than the dangerous fire-making implements they are can be easily purchased by anyone who has enough money and interest. 

Love living in 2018. It's the best.

You get the idea. Once you've seen one person shooting a working flamethrower that's built to look like a toy, you've seen them all.

Just be careful what you call it. Although the product is clearly a flamethrower to anyone who possesses a pair of eyes, Musk noted (again) on Twitter that the item has been renamed "Not a Flamethrower" in order to comply with "regulatory/customs rules enacted to inhibit transport of anything called a Flamethrower."

That might have been a joke. You can never really tell with him. Like, look at this tweet.

So probably a joke?

All I know is The Boring Company has chosen a hell of a moment to sell a real, working flamethrower. In the non-stop burning dumpster fire that is 2018, we all need something to keep those flames lit.
