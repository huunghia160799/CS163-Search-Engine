First, we need to understand the origin of this festival.
One upon a time, Buddha stayed at Jetavana pagoda of local influential rich man named Anatapindika near Savatthi area.
At that time, a 30-monk group came to ask Buddha for relaxing at Jetavana pagoda and Buddha agreed. Because of the far and bad road, the rainy season, when the monk group arrives, the clothes were wet and torn to piece.
After three-month period relaxing and training of monks, Buddha allowed the group stays some time to make the new clothes. It was this time, Lady Visakha, a big helper to monks, first offered Buddh. Since then, the tradition offering to groups of monks in the first month after finishing the three-month relaxing period has carried out.
Depending on the condition of each pagoda, the festival days in the month are different.
