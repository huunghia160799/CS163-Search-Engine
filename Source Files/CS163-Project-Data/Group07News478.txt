DIES'EL NOT DO Brits are shunning ‘dirty diesels’ with a 30 per cent drop in new car sales
Brits are turning their back on diesels with petrol cars now make up 62 per cent of new vehicles
DIESELS are in decline yet again with the latest figures for new car sales in June 2018 seeing a drop by almost a third.
The UK market as a whole, however, saw a less dramatic shift in car buying, with a moderate drop of 3.5 per cent year-on-year.
Now almost 62 per cent of Brits own a new petrol-engined car, and 73,000 people bought an electric or hybrid car in the last 12 months.
Government has taken a hard line on car emissions, with major city mayors recently calling for the complete ban of petrol and diesel sales in the UK to be brought forward a decade to 2030.
Owners of older cars are already being punished for driving in central London following Mayor Sadiq Khan's introduction of a daily £10 T-Charge for toxic vehicles in October 2017. This in addition to the £11.50 Congestion Charge.
Meanwhile, small cars remain the most popular choice for British buyers. The Ford Fiesta, Volkswagen Golf, Vauxhall Corsa, MINI and Volkswagen Polo make up the top five best-selling vehicles in June.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders also announced today that new van registrations dropped by almost six per cent last month alone.
All small, medium and large vans experienced a decline, however, the sale of pick-up trucks has increased over four per cent year-on-year.
