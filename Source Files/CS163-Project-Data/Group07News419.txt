UK QUAKE Earthquake strikes Surrey and Sussex making buildings shake – the SEVENTH quake in just three months

Gatwick Airport was caught up in the drama as stunned witnesses describe tremors as like 'two explosions' in southern England today

AN earthquake struck the south of England today — causing homes and offices to shake while witnesses described hearing "two huge explosions".

Passengers at Gatwick Airport reported feeling the ground moving beneath them in what is the seventh UK quake in just three months.

The British Geological Survey confirmed the 3.1-magnitute quake struck around the Surrey and Sussex areas at 11:53am.

US counterparts put the epicentre at Cranleigh, Surrey — a small village just west of Crawley.

Twitter user TwoWheeledTank said: "Just experienced a short #earthquake in #Crawley".

Samantha Ferguson wrote: "My whole flat just shook underneath me!"

And James Billington said: "I'm in Dorking and the office just shook. Not another Surrey earthquake, surely?? The end is nigh".

It is the third earthquake in the region in just two weeks and the seventh since April 1.

A 2.4-magnitude tremor was centred near Newdigate, Surrey last Friday — the same area as a 2.6-magnitude quake two days earlier.

Scientists at the BGS said: "A number of reports have been received from members of the public in Newdigate, Dorking, Horley and Charlwood, Surrey and from Crawley and Horsham, West Sussex.

"This event locates in the same region as previous ones that have occurred since April".

They said witnesses had told of hearing a "creak" noise as the ground trembled.
