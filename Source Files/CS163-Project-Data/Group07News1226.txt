The Female Couples Remaking the Restaurant Industry

On a cold February morning, Erika Nakamura, 37, studious in gold wire-rim glasses, quietly shaved panels of beef with a blade curved like a scimitar. Standing close, hair tucked under a backward baseball cap, Jocelyn Guest, 34, alternated between a hook and a short skinny knife, frenching a cavernous rack of lamb to expose the bones and make it “prettier,” she said.

In 2016, the two women opened White Gold Butchers, a meat shop and restaurant on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. They joined an increasing cohort of American women at the helm of their own establishments. And they became part of a vanguard of female couples who are changing the notion of a mom-and-pop. Their emergence comes at a critical moment: In the past seven months, a number of male chefs and restaurateurs have been accused by former employees of making unwanted advances and fostering work environments in which men felt at liberty to grope women on staff. (Among them was Ken Friedman, whose restaurant group includes White Gold; no allegations of misconduct have been made there, and he declined to comment for this piece.)

These stories are part of a larger pattern of brutality built into the bones of professional kitchens, many of which follow some form of the brigade de cuisine — essentially a caste system that was devised by the 19th-century French chef Auguste Escoffier, an army veteran, to mirror the military’s unyielding chain of command. In the classic hierarchy, every member of the kitchen was assigned a rank and value, from apprentice to commis to the chefs de partie, and held accountable for individual components of a dish, each owing unquestioning fealty to tiers of superiors, rising upward to the chef. How else could the back of the house survive the inferno of a Saturday night, with all the burners on full blast, the printer rat-a-tatting tickets and half the proteins 86’ed? In battle, souls are forged. Never mind that, along the way, a cook might get branded by a white-hot spoon pressed into the flesh.

For much of the brigade’s existence, its members have been almost exclusively male. But this doesn’t mean that the system is intrinsically patriarchal. Men claim no monopoly on abuses of power in the kitchen — several high-profile female chefs have been named in lawsuits — although men are more likely than women to be given the power to abuse. And the presence of women at the top has not always protected restaurant workers from harassment, as was the case at New York’s gastropub the Spotted Pig, where chef April Bloomfield has since apologized for not knowing the extent of co-owner Friedman’s behavior.

But it’s worth asking whether there’s a difference in restaurants run entirely by women — particularly ones run by female couples linked in life as in work, who consciously model collaboration from the top down. Might they suggest a better way?

Preeti Mistry, 41, was determined to banish the ghosts of kitchens past when she opened the Indian pizzeria Navi Kitchen in the Bay Area in 2017 with her wife, Ann Nadeau, 43. No longer would a cook need to stow a paring knife in her back pocket — as Mistry did early in her career — to whip out if a guy on the line tried to cop a feel. There would be no hazing in the walk-in, no obscene tirades, no employees going home to cry their eyes out. Above all, no one would rule by fear, perhaps the most radical break from the brigade. “When a 6-foot-2 white guy is red in the face, screaming expletives,” Mistry says, “someone else might see their football coach or their dad” — that is, an exemplar of tough love. Instead, as a small-statured, queer woman of color, she felt threatened.
Mentors were few for these lesbian chefs as they came up the ranks; it seemed that a male chef was more likely to give opportunities to a male cook in whom he saw a younger version of himself. Some of the women felt pressure to act “butch” in order to fit in. “It evened the playing field,” says Elise Kornack, 31, who until last year ran the tasting menu restaurant Take Root in Brooklyn with her wife, Anna Hieronimus, 31. For Deborah VanTrece, 58, who owns Twisted Soul Cookhouse & Pours in Atlanta with her wife, Lorraine Lane, 50, the situation is now reversed, with few men applying for jobs in her kitchen: “They tell me, the idea of working under a lady chef — they just can’t get with it.” At the modern Japanese restaurant n/naka in Los Angeles, where Niki Nakayama, 43, cooks alongside her wife and sous-chef, Carole Iida-Nakayama, 40, the men who are hired tend to have sisters (so they’re accustomed to following women’s orders).

Now mentors themselves, these women are mindful of nourishing their employees’ careers. “We’re just a steppingstone,” says Jody Williams, who opened the Mediterranean-inflected Via Carota in Manhattan’s West Village in 2014 with her partner and fellow chef Rita Sodi, both in their early 50s. Nakayama seeks to preserve a meditative atmosphere at her restaurant, in which cooks have a chance to “learn and be bored, and have that boredom turn into mastery” — essential for a kaiseki meal that unfolds in delicate stanzas and infinitesimal details including beads of ponzu gel set with the precision of a chemist’s pipette.

When straight couples run restaurants, often it’s the man who takes the mantle of chef while the woman welcomes guests in the front of house or focuses on pastry. This reflects an industry-wide ratio: Only a fifth of chefs and head cooks in the U.S. are women, according to 2017 Bureau of Labor statistics. The dynamic for gay women collaborating at the top is different, as all roles are open, including those usually ascribed to men. Yet one difficulty of dual leadership is sorting out who’s actually in charge. At Twisted Soul, Lane, who composes a cocktail list to match the Southern cuisine, acknowledges the hierarchy with a laugh: “Here comes the chef, she’s the talent” — meaning VanTrece. One partner might handle equipment and inventory, the other payroll and finances. Still, employees can be confused when taught opposing techniques — for making porchetta at White Gold, say, or shaving Parmesan at Via Carota. Sodi once arrived at work to find a dish slightly altered from her instructions. “I said, ‘Jody?’ and the cook said yes,” she recalled. A call home was placed, a compromise reached.

Sodi and Williams are both stubborn enough that they “try not to be together in the kitchen,” Sodi says wryly. Fortunately, each owns her own restaurant (Williams oversees the French bistro Buvette; Sodi runs the Tuscan restaurant I Sodi) in addition to Via Carota, where they schedule themselves on alternating shifts. Still, in emergencies they sublimate their egos and jump on the line to help each other. “We have differences of opinion,” Williams says. “But we can finish each other’s plates, sentences, thoughts.” Before they opened Via Carota, they rarely saw each other — a common complaint for couples in the restaurant industry. By choosing to work together, these women have found a way to give priority to their family life without curtailing their ambitions.

“There was once in the western parts of Libya ... a race which was ruled by women and followed a manner of life unlike that which prevails among us,” wrote the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus in the first century B.C. He was speaking of that tribe of women warriors, the Amazons, who according to myth founded a dominion that required no input from men, beyond some brief assistance in propagating the species and raising children. The story has always sounded improbable: How could women, whether in the savage ancient world or today’s slightly more civilized one, ever hold all the positions of power and make all the rules? What would those rules be?

The women who run these restaurants are figuring it out. “We’re trying to create a different kind of environment that doesn’t exist outside our four walls,” Nadeau says. None of these places are utopias, and unlearning behavior is an ongoing struggle. “You wake one day and realize, I really yelled at that kid and I don’t know why,” Nakamura says. At Twisted Soul, “it isn’t all sugar-coated,” VanTrece says. But there’s a give-and-take that she thinks might not happen in a predominantly male kitchen: “If you cry on the line, I’m O.K. with it.”

Eliminating hierarchy entirely is difficult and perhaps not even desirable, but productive change begins with the premise that the staff is an ensemble in which “nobody is dispensable,” Williams says; as she sees it, even her dishwashers are training to one day become chefs. Nakamura and Guest, who left White Gold in March and moved north of the city, made a point of hiring a group of peers whom they considered equals in skill. The shop was an intimate setting — anybody walking in the tight space behind the butchers had to warn them first or risk getting accidentally stabbed — and Guest hoped the quality of their work always reflected genuine camaraderie: “Don’t do anything because I said so but because we’re a family.” It’s a spirit that spilled over to their customers, who brought them canned pâtés from trips abroad and hand-knit mittens at Christmas.

It once was enough for a restaurant to simply serve great food; no one had to think about the anonymous, invisible serfs who made it. In Mistry’s first years as a cook, she toiled in a basement assembling canapés for models and movie stars: “They don’t know you exist, and if they did, they wouldn’t care.” But now diners do care. Some question whether they should patronize establishments reputed to have enabled sexual harassment. Others are choosing to support a different kind of restaurant — one where chefs make a safe working environment not a goal but a baseline; where employees, regardless of gender, orientation or ethnicity, can thrive. As historian Adrienne Mayor wrote in her 2014 study “The Amazons,” looking back on the society in which women ruled, “The surprise answer to the question of who will be dominated and tamed is no one.”

Nakamura recalled an afternoon last fall when a father brought his young daughter into White Gold. Beaming, he waved a hand at the butchers behind the counter. “Look!” he said. But what did he want his child to see? Two women, smiling, holding knives. Two women with power, who know how to use it.
