Stoppage Time Has Been Filled With Goals
By JOE WARD JULY 9, 2018

There have been 23 goals scored in the 90th minute and second-half stoppage time so far in this World Cup, shattering the previous high of 14, set four years ago in Brazil. And many have not been meaningless tack-on goals, either: Of the 23, more than half have been tying or go-ahead scores. Only one has been the result of a penalty kick.
