ast summer, Adele Adkins bowed out early from what proclaimed to be her last ever performances due to damaged vocal cords, leaving many fans worried over when they would see the star again.

But now reports suggest the 30-year-old could be back sooner than imagined – in the charts, at least.

The Sun claims that Adkins has returned to her London hometown from US, where she's been living, with the intention to make new music. 

“She’s back in the UK and intends to write here,” the report says. “A number of studio musicians have been approached to work with her and she’s already penned some of the songs.”

Adkins' last album, 25, was released in November 25, a few weeks after the surprise release of Hello, her first new single in three years. Both broke sales records, but led to such a gruelling tour regime that Adkins was left with vocal cord damage. It was suggested that she could take a 10 year break to raise her son.

Adkins famously writes the majority of her music without co-writers. Nearly all of 19, her debut album, was written by her alone, to the extent that when it was suggested that she worked with famous Swedish hitmaker Max Martin, Adkins wasn't aware of his existence. 

On 25, Adkins collaborated far more – albeit with music's most-proven writers, Greg Kurstin, Paul Epworth and Ryan Tedder. With Kurstin and Tedder based in the US, it will be intriguing to see who she chooses to write with for a new album. 

Since finishing her Adele Live tour, Adkins has settled into a domestic life of extraordinary proportions. She married her partner and the father of her son, Simon Konecki, in a secret ceremony in Los Angeles; threw a Titanic-themed 30th birthday party and ordained in order to marry friends Alan Carr and Paul Drayton.
