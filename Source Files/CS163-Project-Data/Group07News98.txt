US Open 2018: Tee times, how to watch and more.
"The 2018 US Open is set to tee off on Thursday, June 14 at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in Southampton, New York. I like to tune into the final round on Sunday each year because: A) it's Father's Day and lying on the couch to watch golf is a total dad move, and B) the course is set up to be so difficult that the world's greatest golfers occasionally look mortal, making a terrible golfer like me momentarily feel better about himself.
What are the storylines for this, the 118th US Open?
Well, Tiger Woods is back playing tournament golf again, which is fun whether you are rooting for him or against him. It's been a decade since Tiger won his third US Open title, but he looks healthy and is again a threat.
The only major title that has escaped Phil Mickelson is the US Open, where he has finished runner-up six times, including in 2004 at Shinnecock Hills. Can Lefty complete his trophy case with a win this weekend on Long Island?
Jordan Spieth won in 2015 and is looking to nab a second title. And after Sergio Garcia won the Masters last year, Rickie Fowler is now viewed as the best player never to win a major, a label he will try to shed on Sunday at Shinnecock Hills. (Fowler is also the most colorfully dressed golfer to win or not win a major.)
