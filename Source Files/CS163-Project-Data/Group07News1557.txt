Trump targets another $200 billion in China imports with tariffs 


Donald Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese imports as trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies reached new heights on Tuesday.

The US president said in a White House statement on Monday evening that he had instructed the US Trade Representative’s office to identify $200 billion in imports from the Asian nation for additional tariffs of 10 percent.

He said the US would impose tariffs on another $200 billion after that if Beijing retaliates.

“The United States will no longer be taken advantage of on trade by China and other countries in the world,” he said in the statement. “We will continue using all available tools to create a better and fairer trading system for all Americans.”

The threat comes just three days after Mr Trump vowed to impose tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods amid failed trade negotiations with Beijing. He said at the time he would impose even more duties if China retaliated, which Beijing immediately said it would do.

The US imported $505 billion of goods from China last year and exported about $130 billion, leaving a 2017 trade deficit of $376 billion, according to US government figures.

Monday's announcement had immediate effect on the markets as Asian stocks dropped alongside S&P 500 Index futures with investors fearing the implications of confrontation between China and the US.

In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell 0.43 percent or 97.89 points to 22,582.44 in early trade while the broader Topix index was down 0.39 percent or 6.88 points at 1,764.55.

Mr Trump said he was taking action because China has raised tariffs on US exports and “has no intention of changing its unfair practices related to the acquisition of American intellectual property and technology.”
