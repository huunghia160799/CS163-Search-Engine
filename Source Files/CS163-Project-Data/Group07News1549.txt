James Comey 'insubordinate' and made 'serious error of judgment,' new report finds


James Comey, the former FBI Director, was "insubordinate" and made a "serious error of judgment" in his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, the US Department of Justice has found.

In a report by the department's inspector general it also emerged that the FBI agent who led the probe, Peter Strzok, sent a text message in August 2016 vowing to "stop" Donald Trump winning the presidential election.

The explosive report into events in 2016 found it was "extraordinary and insubordinate" for Mr Comey to hold a press conference announcing he was not recommending charges against Mrs Clinton.

Mr Comey then made a "serious error of judgment" in publicly declaring the reopening of the case days before the election.

However, the report did not find "political bias on Comey’s part". Mr Comey said nothing in the report "makes me think we did the wrong thing".

The report detailed an exchange of text messages between Mr Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page on Aug 8, 2016.

She wrote: "(Trump's) not ever going to become president, right? Right?!"

He replied: "No. No he won't. We'll stop it."

The inspector general, Michael Horowitz, said that "cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation".

He could not be sure Mr Strzok was "free from bias" in prioritising investigations into Russian influence on the Trump campaign over new evidence in the Clinton email probe.

The report also criticised Mr Comey for using his personal email account for FBI business, although he did not send any classified information.
