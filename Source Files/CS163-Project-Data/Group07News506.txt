MOBILE MAKEOVER Next iPhone tipped to come in blue, red and orange colour options
A hot new iPhone leak suggests Apple is about to get its fruity handset a major makeover
MOST Apple gadgets these days come in the same old colours – black, white and grey – but that might be about to change.
A top Apple watcher reckons we're going to see brand new paintjobs for this year's iPhone line-up.
According to Ming-Chi Kuo, the 2018 iPhones will be available in "grey, white, blue, red and orange".
That would signal a major shake-up in iPhone design.
The highly respected KGI Securities analyst has an impressive track record on Apple leaks.
For instance, he correctly guessed the iPhone X screen size, the existence Apple's ace ID facial recognition system, the iPhone X price and details about the iPhone 8 camera – to name just a few on-the-mark predictions.
Last year's £999 iPhone X was only available in two colours – Silver and Space Grey.
Apple was a little more liberal with the iPhone 8 design, offering it in Silver, Gold, Space Grey, and (Product)Red, a special colour option for charity.
But Apple hasn't really shaken up iPhone paintjobs in years.
The only notable exception was the colourful, budget iPhone 5C, which launched way back in 2013.
It was available in multiple bright colours, including blue, green, yellow and white on the back – all with a black glass front.
That means an orange iPhone would be an entirely new addition to Apple's handset family.
