"Nintendo Switch now works with these 20+ wireless USB headsets
Thanks to firmware updates, the Switch's dock will now let you use wireless USB headsets like this Logitech G933.
Sean Hollister/CNET
When the Nintendo Switch arrived a year ago, you couldn't connect a wireless headset at all. Your only private listening option was a pair of wired headphones, plugged directly into the 3.5mm headphone jack on top of the handheld console.
But Nintendo has quietly added support for a whole bunch of wireless USB headphones, too, meaning you can now play Switch on your big-screen TV as loud as you like without waking up the neighbors. Just plug your USB dongle into the Switch dock.
Which wireless headsets work with Nintendo Switch, though? We teamed up with our friends at GameSpot to test more than 30 pairs, and we'll update this guide if Nintendo adds more support (or as new headsets come out).
Just know that the Switch still doesn't support voice chat through a headset. It's one of the many features we hope Nintendo adds.
