The Sex Toy Shops That Switched On a Feminist Revolution
Think back, for a moment, to the year 1968. Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy were 
assassinated. The Beatles released the “White Album.” North Vietnam launched the Tet offensive. 
And American women discovered the clitoris. O.K., that last one may be a bit of an overreach, 
but 1968 was when “The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm,” a short essay by Anne Koedt, went that 
era’s version of viral. Jumping off of the Masters and Johnson bombshell that women who didn’t 
climax during intercourse could have multiple orgasms with a vibrator, Koedt called for replacing 
Freud’s fantasy of “mature” orgasm with women’s lived truth: It was all about the clitoris. That 
assertion single-handedly, as it were, made female self-love a political act, and claimed orgasm 
as a serious step to women’s overall emancipation. It also threatened many men, who feared 
obsolescence, or at the very least, loss of primacy. Norman Mailer, that famed phallocentrist, 
raged in his book “The Prisoner of Sex” against the emasculating “plenitude of orgasms” created 
by “that laboratory dildo, that vibrator!” (yet another reason, beyond the whole stabbing incident, 
to pity the man’s poor wives).
To be fair, Mailer & Co. had cause to quake. The quest for sexual self-knowledge, as two new books 
on the history and politics of sex toys reveal, would become a driver of feminist social change, 
striking a blow against men’s overweening insecurity and the attempt (still with us today) to 
control women’s bodies. As Lynn Comella writes in “Vibrator Nation,” retailers like Good Vibrations 
in San Francisco created an erotic consumer landscape different from anything that previously 
existed for women, one that was safe, attractive, welcoming and ultimately subversive, presenting 
female sexual fulfillment as “unattached to reproduction, motherhood, monogamy — even 
heterosexuality.”
