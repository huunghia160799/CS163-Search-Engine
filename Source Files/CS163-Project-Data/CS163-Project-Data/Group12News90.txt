The trailer for “Bleeding Steel” appears to promise Jackie Chan in space, which, face it, sounds like a lot of fun. I am obliged to report that the movie does not quite deliver. Rather, it puts him on a spaceship that for the most part stays on the ground. Not the same thing.

This consistently ridiculous movie, written and directed by Leo Zhang, does offer Jackie Chan mixing it up at a magician’s rehearsal (he pulls a rabbit from a hat) and Jackie Chan kickboxing at the top of the Sydney Opera House. At 64, Mr. Chan is still the most talented and witty athlete in cinema. While some of his recent fare (for instance, “Railroad Tigers” and “The Foreigner”) has gone easy on the stunt work, this sci-fi thriller gives him several opportunities to strut his death-defying stuff.

These scenes provide moments of respite from the movie’s goofy plot, which involves Mr. Chan’s undercover cop, Lin Dong, protecting his daughter, Nancy, the recipient of an artificial heart developed by a doctor researching the engineering of semi-cyber supersoldiers or some such. (For reasons too complicated, and dumb, to get into, Nancy doesn’t know Mr. Chan’s character is her dad.) The villain, André, is a failed experiment in this line. This renders the fellow — who’s made up to look like a minor Sith Lord, or the mascot for a Goth-metal band — very hard to kill. It’s his docked spaceship on which the ostensibly thrilling climax takes place. Eventually the craft does take off, but never leaves the atmosphere, the better to contrive a parachute-free falling stunt for the big finish.
