RESTAURANTS IN HO CHI MINH CITY
To sustain a population of 6 million and a volume of tourist arrival recording at 3 million in 2010, restaurants in Ho Chi Minh city can be proud of themselves. Most restaurants are concentrated in District 1 and 3, near Ben Thanh Market and the Pham Ngu Lao area. Ben Thanh market is a major food court itself. Some recommendations as a start include Quan An Ngon , Pho Hoa, Bach Dang Ice-cream and if you can afford it, a black Vietnamese coffee at Paradise Café on the 5th floor of Rex Hotel. As you get further from the city center, expect more typical Southern dish such as Lau mam or Com tam. Always watch for restaurant hygiene and avoid eating lettuce if possible.
