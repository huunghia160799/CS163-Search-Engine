'NO BABY NO FEE' IVF clinic promises couples a healthy child within 2 years or their money back

IVI Baby charges up to £26,500 for the scheme, with a 'guarantee' of a baby after three IVF cycles - or a full refund

AN IVF clinic has launched a “no baby, no fee” deal that promises wannabe parents a healthy tot within two years.

Critics accuse doctors of using the language of ambulance-chasing lawyers and giving vulnerable couples false hope.

IVI Baby charges up to £26,500 for the scheme, with a “guarantee” of a baby after three IVF cycles — or your money back.

The Spanish firm has a London clinic.  Its offer is open to women under 38 who are a healthy weight with no history of failed IVF and sufficient egg reserves.

But Josephine Quintavalle, of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, said: “This sounds more like a ‘no win, no fee’ legal construct than a genuine approach to curing infertility.”

Norman Wells, of the Family Education Trust, said: “A potential danger of offering a special deal is that fertility clinics may be inclined to take risks with patient welfare in desperate bid to achieve results.”

A cycle of IVF typically costs about £5,000 when paid for privately in the UK, with 53 per cent getting pregnant after three cycles.
