The Atlanta Hawks selected University of Maryland guard Kevin Huerter with the 19th overall pick of the 2018 NBA Draft on Thursday night.
A 6-foot-7 shooting guard, Huerter started all 65 games for the Terrapins in his two seasons with the program. He averaged 14.8 points per game in 2017-18 and shot 41.7 percent from 3-point range.
The Hawks finished last in the Eastern Conference last season and were reportedly seeking talented wing players. Earlier in the night, they drafted Luka Doncic third overall but traded his rights to Dallas for the rights to point guard Trae Young.
Huerter’s draft stock rose around the time of the NBA Draft combine, to the point where he was expected to be a first-round draft pick. He is the first Terrapin picked in the first round since center Alex Len went fifth overall in 2013.
