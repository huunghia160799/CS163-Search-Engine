On October 31st Manga Entertainment will be shipping Angel Cop: The Collection on DVD as well as the third and final volume of Rayearth on VHS.

In Angel Cop, Japan is under attack. A group of violent terrorists, known as the Red May, have launched a wave of bombings and murders across Tokyo, 
threatening the stability of the entire country. In response, the government calls in the Special Security Force (SSF), 
an elite law enforcement division that uses any method necessary to protect public safety.

As the Red May continue their assault, the SSF unleash their deadliest
weapon: Angel, a woman whose skill in combat is matched by her beauty. But Angel soon learns that the situation is far more complex and dangerous than she thought. 
The terrorists are dying before she can get to them. Ripped apart by some ferocious and inexplicable force, 
whomever else is after the Red May has the power to destroy anything or anyone in their way - including Angel and her team!

As the mystery deepens and the body count rises, a lethal government
conspiracy is brought to light. What is the mysterious "H-file"? And will Angel live long enough to find out?
