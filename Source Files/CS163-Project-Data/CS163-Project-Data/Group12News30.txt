The Vans Warped Tour 
the music festival that has crossed the country each year since 1995, and is frequently called a 
punk rock summer camp is on its last run.
For 24 years, the Warped Tour created spaces for metal, punk and ska fans to meet their idols 
and mosh together under the hot sun: Each summer, about 70 bands and artists would play in some 40 
locations, welcoming hundreds of thousands of tattooed concertgoers clad in band tees and Vans 
checkered slip-ons. Many musical acts that helped define the late 1990s and early 2000s graced 
Warped Tour stages, including Blink-182, Reel Big Fish and Eminem.
But recently, the show popularity has declined, among both bands and attendees. Some music 
festivals are bigger than ever Coachella drew more than 200,000 people to the California 
desert for two days in April but the Warped Tour doesn't have the same cultural cache it once had.
The die-hard Warped fan was still coming, but the ones for the future seemed to drop off, said the 
festivals founder and longtime producer Kevin Lyman in an email.
