RAIN AND SHINE UK weather to bring torrential rain putting Britain’s 30C heatwave on hold with thunderstorms set to hit today

The hot weather will break into torrential downpours and thundery showers in the south today - but it's a clear picture for Saturday

HEAVY rain and showers will today interrupt Britain’s longest heatwave in more than 40 years — but only briefly.

Up to 20mm is expected to fall in the South East — but the stormy weather is set to clear for Super Saturday as England take on Sweden in the World Cup quarter finals.

It will also be the first weekend of Wimbledon and the London Pride march — with pub industry insiders predicting an extra eight million pints will be sold as Brits flock to beer gardens.

Overall temperatures will be around 82F (28C) for the 11th consecutive day. The hottest June since 1976 caused reservoirs to run dry and left a hosepipe ban looming.

This is expected to trigger some torrential downpours and thunderstorms — a jarring end to several days of a 30C-plus heatwave.

Parts of the south west including Dorset have already had a washout — and more southeasterly areas will see the rainfall tomorrow.

But the showers will clear quickly as the we approach the weekend as sunny skies and high temperatures take hold once again.

Some patchy cloud will be the only spoiler on an otherwise sunny 30C day on Friday in the south — with an even warmer picture in store for a day of sport on Saturday.

The highest temperature is expected to be recorded in the London area on Saturday with 31C or 32C forecast.

Elsewhere it will stay largely dry and warm on Friday and Saturday across the UK.

Light drizzle is expected to affect northwestern parts at times over the weekend but it will mainly be a sunny picture across the country.
