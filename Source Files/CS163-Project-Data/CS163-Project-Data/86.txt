With only 25 cents, from the city center (Ben Thanh market), you can take a bus to Cu Chi, 70 km (43.5 miles) from city center. 

2. Least expensive districts:

When living in district 8, district 11, district 12, Thu Duc District, Go Vap District and suburb areas like Hoc Mon, Can Gio, Cu Chi, you can save a lot of money.
