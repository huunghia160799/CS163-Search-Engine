Thien Hau is a goddess whose first name is Mi Chau. She was born in Phuoc Kien of China, in 1044, Tong Nhan Tong dynasty. When she was eight years old, she could read. She became a nun of Taoism when she was eleven years old. When she was thirteen years old, she was given ancient books by gods. Since then, she had trained according to the books until she reached the peak of the way in Taoism.
One day, her father named Lam Tich Khanh and two her older brothers transported salt to GiangTay to sell by boat. On the way, the boat was struck by a big storm. At that time, she was sitting to weave fabric beside her mother, but her soul went out to save her father and brothers.
She used her teeth to keep father’s corner of the coat and the two hands kept the two brother. At that time, her mother called her, which makes her answer. She just opened her lips to answer, her father was swept away by the water stream and she saved only the two brothers.
Since then, each time boats have been in danger, people have called her for helping. In 1110, she was conferred Thien HauThanh Mau by Tong Dynasty. Since then, in China, many temples have been built to worship her and they were called after her name, Thien Hau Thanh Mau, shortly Thien Hau.
