What Happens if the Gender Gap Becomes a Gender Chasm?
For nearly 40 years, the gender gap in voting has been the subject of continued speculation. How much does it matter? Would it be wide enough to put Democrats in office? Now, with President Trump ascendant, the question becomes still more urgent: What happens if the gender gap becomes a gender chasm?

On July 7, CNN predicted that the 2018 election would “have the largest gender gap on record for a midterm election since 1958.” On the same day, Dan Balz, my former colleague at The Washington Post, wrote:

The disconnect between President Trump and female voters is serious and not getting better. That’s a potentially big problem for Republicans in the November elections.

Polling data this year clearly suggests that women are moving away from the Republican Party.

The potential gender gap in congressional voting has risen from 20 and 22 points in 2014 and 2016, according to exit polls, to 33 points in a Quinnipiac Poll published earlier this month. Men of all races say they intend to vote for Republican House candidates 50-42, while women of all races say they intend to vote for Democratic candidates 58-33.

Significantly, white women, a majority of whom backed Trump in 2016, now say they intend to vote for Democratic House candidates in 2018 by a 14-point margin, 52-38, according to Quinnipiac. White men say intend to vote for Republican House candidates 56-38 in 2018.

Polling also suggests that Trump could do better in 2020 among men than he did in 2016, but his approval ratings among women of all races are dismal. The Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted June 27-July 2 found that men of all races approve of how Trump is handling the job by 54-45, while women of all races disapprove, 65-32, a 42-point gap. (The gap is determined in this way: If there were no difference between men and women, the gap would be zero. Using this case as an example, men are plus nine on Trump and women are minus 33, which produces a total gap of 42 points.)

In 2016, Trump won white men 56.05 to 36.61, carrying white men without college degrees 61.20 to 31.82, while barely losing white men with degrees, 46.60 to 45.30, according to the Cooperative Congressional Election Study.

In 2016, Trump carried white women, 51.86 to 43.15 — winning white women without college degrees 58.17 to 37.25 and losing white women with degrees 38.38 to 55.73.

In other words, even though Trump carried both white men and women in 2016, there was still a 10.73 point gender gap among white voters.

In that election Trump won men of all races 48.75 percent to Hillary Clinton’s 44.21 percent, but lost among women of all races 42.60 percent to Clinton’s 52.48 percent — for a gender gap of 14.42 percentage points.

I asked Shana Gadarian, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, about the growing distaste for Trump among all women, and she wrote back:

One of the things that I think that women are responding to in this current political moment is both a realization of past wrongs and the real threat of a loss of status.

Gadarian pointed out that

On the ground, resistance acts like the teachers union strikes, protests about family separation and marches for gun control are being fueled by women who see this administration as hostile to issues of basic decency, dignity and safety in your workplace, and compassion for children.

Which leads us to a second question: Will the votes of women who are hostile to Trump eventually take him down, along with the Republican majority in Congress? Or will we see a repeat of elections in the 1980s, when Democratic hopes of capitalizing on the votes of women fizzled?
