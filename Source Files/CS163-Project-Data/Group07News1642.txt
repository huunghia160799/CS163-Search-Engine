Fortnite Season 5 kicks off with golf karts, mysterious portals
Fortnite's highly anticipated Season 5 began Thursday and it allows you to take your friends for a ride in new All Terrain Karts.

Beyond the addition of the game's first real vehicle, the update -- known as Worlds Collide -- adds Rift portals that have appeared around the island. Plus there's a new horde mode and you can battle it out with an old-timey set of flintlock weapons.


Developer Epic revealed the full extent of the changes Season 5 brings in a blog post on Thursday.

Additionally, motion controls have been added to the wildly popular Nintendo Switch version -- addressing one of our few complaints about the Switch release.

There's no word on the return of Playground mode, however, which went offline as the fifth season kicked off.

My love of football has always placed me in a difficult position.

On one hand, there’s an environment of conflict, oppression and political injustice around the sport. On the other, there are football’s simple, scintillating pleasures. This tension — between the ugliness of the game’s culture and its aesthetic beauty — has always been acute for L.G.B.T. fans, even more so for activists from our community. And at this World Cup, where President Vladimir Putin has presided over a hugely successful global spectacle while jailing and torturing dissidents (notably the Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov), the contradiction between the joy of football and the misery of its culture and politics has been especially sharp.

But contradictions can be combated. And in the eight years since FIFA awarded the World Cup to Mr. Putin’s Russia, L.G.B.T. activists have made great strides in their efforts to make the sport more accessible, more welcoming, more truly beautiful.
